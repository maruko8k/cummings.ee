as is the sea marvelous
from godâ€™s
hands which sent her forth
to sleep upon the world

and the earth withers
the moon crumbles
one by one
stars flutter into dust

but the sea
does not change
and she goes forth out of hands and
she returns into hands

and is with sleep ....

love,
the breaking

of your
soul
upon
my lips
