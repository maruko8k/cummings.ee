title: Amores I
text: |-
  consider O
  woman this
  my body.
  for it has

  lain
  with empty arms
  upon the giddy hills
  to dream of you,

  approve these
  firm unsated
  eyes
  which have beheld

  nightâ€™s speechless carnival
  the painting
  of the dark
  with meteors

  streaming from playful
  immortal hands
  the bursting
  of the wafted stars

  (in time to come you shall
  remember of this night amazing
  esctasies    slowly,
  in the glutted

  heart fleet
  flowerterrible
  memories
  shall

  rise, slowly
  return upon the
                  red elected lips

  scaleless visions)
