title: Songs VI
text: |-
  when god lets my body go

  From each brave eye shall sprout a tree
  fruit that dangles therefrom

  the purpled world will dance upon
  Between my lips which did sing

  a rose shall beget the spring
  that maidens whom passion wastes

  will lay between their little breasts
  My strong fingers beneath the snow

  Into strenuous birds shall go
  my love walking in the grass

  their wings will touch her face
  and all the while shall my heart be

  With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea
