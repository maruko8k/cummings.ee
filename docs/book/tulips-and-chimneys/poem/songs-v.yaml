  Doll’s boy ’s asleep
  under a stile
  he sees eight and twenty
  ladies in a line

  the first lady
  says to nine ladies
  his lips drink water
  but his heart drinks wine

  the tenth lady
  says to nine ladies
  they must chain his foot
  for his wrist ’s too fine

  the nineteenth
  says to nine ladies
  you take his mouth
  for his eyes are mine.

  Doll’s boy ’s asleep
  under the stile
  for every mile the feet go
  the heart goes nine
