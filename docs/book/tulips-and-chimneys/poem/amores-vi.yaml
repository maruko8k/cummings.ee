title: Amores VI
text: |-
  i like
  to think that on
  the flower you gave me when we
  loved

       the far-
  departed mouth sweetly-saluted
  lingers.
          if one marvel

  seeing the hunger of my
  lips for a dead thing,
  i shall instruct
  him silently with becoming

  steps to seek
  your face    and i
  entreat, by certain foolish perfect
  hours

       dead too,
  if that he come receive
  him as your lover sumptuously
  being

  kind
      because i trust him to
  your grace, and for
  in his own land

  he is called death.
