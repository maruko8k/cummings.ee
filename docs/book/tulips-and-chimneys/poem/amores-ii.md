there is a
moon sole
in the blue
night

     amorous of waters

tremulous,
blinded with silence the
undulous heaven yearns where

in tense starlessness
anoint with ardor
the yellow lover

stands in the dumb dark
svelte
and
urgent

       (again

love i slowly
gather
of thy languorous mouth the

thrilling
flower)
