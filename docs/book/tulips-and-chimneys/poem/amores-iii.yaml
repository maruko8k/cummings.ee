title: Amores III
text: |-
  as is the sea marvelous
  from godâ€™s
  hands which sent her forth
  to sleep upon the world

  and the earth withers
  the moon crumbles
  one by one
  stars flutter into dust

  but the sea
  does not change
  and she goes forth out of hands and
  she returns into hands

  and is with sleep ....

  love,
        the breaking

  of your
          soul
          upon
  my lips
