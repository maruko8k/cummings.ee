 the season ’tis,my lovely lambs,

 of Sumner Volstead Christ and Co.
 the epoch of Mann’s righteousness
 the age of dollars and no sense.
 Which being quite beyond dispute

 as prove from Troy(N.Y.)to Cairo
 (Egypt)the luminous dithyrambs
 of large immaculate unmute
 antibolschevistic gents
 (each manufacturing word by word
 his own unrivalled brand of pyro
 -technic blurb anent the(hic)
 hero dead that gladly(sic)
 in far lands perished of unheard
 of maladies including flu)

 my little darlings,let us now
 passionately remember how—
 braving the worst,of peril heedless,
 each braver than the other,each
 (a typewriter within his reach)
 upon his fearless derrière
 sturdily seated—Colonel Needless
 To Name and General You know who
 a string of pretty medals drew

 (while messrs jack james john and jim
 in token of their country’s love
 received my dears the order of
 The Artificial Arm and Limb)

 —or,since bloodshed and kindred questions
 inhibit unprepared digestions,
 come:let us mildly contemplate
 beginning with his wellfilled pants
 earth’s biggest grafter,nothing less;
 the Honorable Mr.(guess)
 who,breathing on the ear of fate,
 landed a seat in the legislat-
 ure whereas tommy so and so
 (an erring child of circumstance
 whom the bulls nabbed at 33rd)

 pulled six months for selling snow
