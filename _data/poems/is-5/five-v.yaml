 if i have made,my lady,intricate
 imperfect various things chiefly which wrong
 your eyes(frailer than most deep dreams are frail)
 songs less firm than your body’s whitest song
 upon my mind—if i have failed to snare
 the glance too shy—if through my singing slips
 the very skilful strangeness of your smile
 the keen primeval silence of your hair

 —let the world say “his most wise music stole
 nothing from death”—
                      you only will create
 (who are so perfectly alive)my shame:
 lady through whose profound and fragile lips
 the sweet small clumsy feet of April came

 into the ragged meadow of my soul.
