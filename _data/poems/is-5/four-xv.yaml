 i am a beggar always
 who begs in your mind
 
 (slightly smiling,patient,unspeaking
 with a sign on his
 breast
 BLIND)yes i
 
 am this person of whom somehow
 you are never wholly rid(and who
 
 does not ask for more than
 just enough dreams to
 live on)
         after all,kid
 
 you might as well
 toss him a few thoughts
 
 a little love preferably,
 anything which you can’t
 pass off on other people:for
 instance a
 plugged promise—
 
 then he will maybe(hearing something
 fall into his hat)go wandering
 after it with fingers;till having
 
 found
 what was thrown away
                     himself
 taptaptaps out of your brain,hopes,life
 
 to(carefully turning a
 corner)never bother you any more.
