 death is more than
 certain a hundred these
 sounds crowds odours it
 is in a hurry
 beyond that any this
 taxi smile or angle we do
 
 not sell and buy
 things so necessary as
 is death and unlike shirts
 neckties trousers
 we cannot wear it out
 
 no sir which is why
 granted who discovered
 America ether the movies
 may claim general importance
 
 to me to you nothing is
 what particularly
 matters hence in a
 
 little sunlight and less
 moonlight ourselves against the worms
 
 hate laugh shimmy
