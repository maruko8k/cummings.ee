 after all white horses are in bed

 will you walking beside me,my very lady,
 if scarcely the somewhat city
 wiggles in considerable twilight

 touch(now)with a suddenly unsaid

 gesture lightly my eyes?
 And send life out of me and the night
 absolutely into me....a wise
 and puerile moving of your arm will
 do suddenly that

                 will do
 more than heroes beautifully in shrill
 armour colliding on huge blue horses,
 and the poets looked at them,and made verses,

 through the sharp light cryingly as the knights flew.
