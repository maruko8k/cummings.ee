 impossibly
 
 motivated by midnight
 the flyspecked abdominous female
 indubitably tellurian
 strolls
        emitting minute grins
 
 each an intaglio.
 Nothing
 has also carved upon her much

 too white forehead a pair of
 eyes which mutter thickly(as one merely
 terriculous American an instant doubts
 the authenticity

 of these antiquitiesâ€”relaxing
                              hurries
 elsewhere;to blow

 incredible wampum
