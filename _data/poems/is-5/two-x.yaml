 the communists have fine Eyes

 some are young some old none
 look alike the flics rush
 batter the crowd sprawls collapses
 singing knocked down trampled the kicked by
 flics rush(the

 Flics,tidiyum,are
 very tidiyum reassuringly similar,
 they all have very tidiyum
 mustaches,and very
 tidiyum chins,and just above
 their very tidiyum ears their
 very tidiyum necks begin)
                          let us add

 that there are 50(fifty)flics for every
 one(1)communist and
 all the flics are very organically
 arranged
 and their nucleus(composed
 of captains in freshly-creased
 -uniforms with only-just-
 shined buttons
 tidiyum
 before and behind)has a nucleolus:

 the Prefect of Police
 
 (a dapper derbied
 creature,swaggers daintily
 twiddling
 his tiny cane
 and,mazurkas about tweak-
 ing his wing collar pecking at his im

 -peccable cravat directing being
 shooting his cuffs
 saluted everywhere saluting
 reviewing processions of minions
 tappingpeopleontheback

 “allezcirculez”)

 —my    he’s brave....
 the
 communists pick
 up themselves friends
 & their hats legs &

 arms brush dirt coats
 smile looking hands
 spit blood teeth

 the Communists have(very)fine eyes
 (which stroll hither and thither through the
 evening in bruised narrow questioning faces)
