 you being in love
 will tell who softly asks in love,
 
 am i separated from your body smile brain hands merely
 to become the jumping puppets of a dream?   oh i mean:
 entirely having in my careful how
 careful arms created this at length
 inexcusable,this inexplicable pleasure—you go from several
 persons:believe me that strangers arrive
 when i have kissed you into a memory
 slowly,oh seriously
 —that since and if you disappear
 
 solemnly
 myselves
 ask “life,the question how do i drink dream smile
 
 and how do i prefer this face to another and
 why do i weep eat sleep—what does the whole intend”
 they wonder.   oh and they cry “to be,being,that i am alive
 this absurd fraction in its lowest terms
 with everything cancelled
 but shadows
 —what does it all come down to?   love?   Love
 if you like and i like,for the reason that i
 hate people and lean out of this windowis love,love
 and the reason that i laugh and breathe is oh love and the reason
 
 that i do not fall into this street is love.”
