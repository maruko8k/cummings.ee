 but observe;although
 once is never the beginning of
 enough,is it(i do not pretend
 to know the reason any more than.)   But look:up-

 raising,hoisting,a little
 perhaps that and this,deftly
 proppping on smallest hands
 the slim hinging you
                     —because
 it’s five o’clock

 and these(i notice)trees winterbrief surly old
 gurgle a nonsense of sparrows,the cathedral
 shudders blackening;
 the sky is washed with tone

 now for a moon
 to squat in first darkness
 —a little moon thinner than

 memory

 faint
 -er
     than all the whys
 which lurk
 between your naked shoulderblades.—Here
 comes a stout fellow in a blouse
 just outside this window,touching the glass
 boxes one by one with his magic
 stick(in which a willing
 bulb of flame bubbles)
                       see

 here and here they explode
 silently into crocuses of brightness.   (That is enough
 of life,for you.   I understand.   Once
 again....)sliding

 a little downward,embrace me with your body’s suddenly
 curving entire warm questions
