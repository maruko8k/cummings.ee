 workingman with hand so hairy-sturdy
 you may turn O turn that airy hurdysturdygurdy
 but when will turn backward O backward Time in your no thy flight
 and make me a child,a pretty dribbling child,a little child.

 In thy your ear:
 en amérique on ne boit que de Jingyale.
 things are going rather kaka
 over there,over there,
 yet we scarcely fare much better—

 what’s become of(if you please)
 all the glory that or which was Greece
 all the grandja
 that was dada?

 make me a child,stout hurdysturdygurdyman
 waiter,make me a child.   So this is Paris.
 i will sit in the corner and drink thinks and think drinks,
 in memory of the Grand and Old days:
 of Amy Sandburg
 of Algernon Carl Swinburned.

 Waiter a drink waiter two or three drinks
 what’s become of Maeterlinck
 now that April’s here!
 (ask the man who owns one
 ask Dad,He knows).
