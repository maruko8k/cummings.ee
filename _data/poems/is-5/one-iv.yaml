 workingman with hand so hairy-sturdy
 you may turn O that airy hurdysturdygurdy
 but when will turn backward O backward Time in your nothy flight
 and make me a child,a pretty dribbling child,a little child.

 In thy your ear:
 en amerique on ne boit que de Jingyale.
 things are going rather kaka
 over there,over there,
 yet we scarcely fare much better-

 what's become of(if you please)
 all the glory that or Which was Greece
 all the grandja
 that was dada?

 make me a child,stout hurdysturdygurdyman
 waiter,make me a child. So this is Paris.
 i will sit in the corner and drink thinks and think drinks,
 in memory of the Grand and Old days:
 of Amy Sandhurg
 of Algernon Carl Swinburned.

 Waiter a drink eaiter two or three drinks
 what's become of Maeterlink
 now that April's here!
 (ask the man who owns one
 ask Dad,He knows).
