 On the assumption that my technique is either compli-
 cated or original or both, the publishers have politely
 requested me to write an introduction to this book.

   At least my theory of technique, if I have one, is very
 far from original, nor is it complicated.  I can express it
 in fifteen words, by quoting The Eternal Question And 
 Immortal Answer of burlesk, viz. "Would you hit a wo-
 man with a child? — No, I'd hit her with a brick."  Like
 the burlesk comedian, I am abnormally fond of that pre-
 cision which creates movement.

   If a poet is anybody, he is somebody to whom things
 made matter very little—somebody who is obsessed by
 Making.  Like all obsessions, the Making obsession has
 disadvantages; for instance, my only interest in mak-
 ing money would be to make it.  Fortunately, however,
 I should prefer to make almost anything else, includ-
 ing locomotives and roses. It is with roses and locomo-
 tives (not to mention acrobats Spring electricity Coney
 Island the 4th of July the eyes of mice and Niagara
 Falls) that my "poems" are competing.

   They are also competing with each other, with ele-
 phants, and with El Greco.

   Ineluctable preoccupation with The Verb gives a poet
 one priceless advantage&#58; whereas nonmakers must con-
 tent themselves with the merely undeniable fact that
 two times two is four, he rejoices in a purely irresist-
 ible truth (to be found, in abbreviated costume, upon
 the title page of the present volume.)
