 because
 you go away i give roses who
 will advise even yourself,lady
 in the most certainly(of what we
 everywhere do not touch)deep
 things;
        remembering ever so
 tinily these,your crisp
 eyes atually shall contain new faeries

 (and if your slim lips are amused,no wisest

 painter of fragile
 Marys will understand
 how smiling may be made as
 skilfully.) But carry
 also,with that indolent and with
 this flower wholly whom you do
 not ever fear,
               me in your heart
 
 softly;not all
 but the beginning
