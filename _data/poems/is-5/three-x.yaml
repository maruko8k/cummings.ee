 sunlight was over
 our mouths fears hearts lungs arms hopes feet hands

 under us the unspeaking Mediterranean bluer
 than we had imagined
 a few cries drifting through
 high air
 a sail a fishing boat somebody an invisible spectator,
 maybe certain nobodies laughing faintly

 playing moving far below us

 perhaps one villa caught like pieces
 of a kite in the trees,here
 and here reflecting
 sunlight
 (everywhere sunlight keen complete
 silent

 and everywhere you your kisses your flesh mind breathing
 beside under around myself)
                            by and by
 
 a fat colour reared itself against the sky and the sea

 ...finally your eyes knew
 me,we smiled to each other,releasing lay,watching
 (sprawling,in
 grass upon a
 cliff)what had been something
 else carefully slowly fatally turning into ourselves...

 while in the very middle of fire all

 the world becoming bright and little melted.
