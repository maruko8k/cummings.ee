 you are not going to,dear.   You are not going to and
 i but that doesn’t in the least matter.   The big
 fear Who held us deeply in His fist is
 
 no longer,can you imagine it
 i can't which doesn’t matter
 and what does is possibly this dear,that we may resume
 impact with the inutile collide
 
 once more with the imaginable,love,and eat sunlight(do
 you believe it?   i begin to and that doesn’t matter)which
 
 i suggest teach us a new terror always
 which shall brighten
 carefully these things we consider life.
 Dear i put my eyes into you but that doesn’t matter
 further than of old
 
 because you fooled the doctors,i touch you with hopes and
 words and with so and so:we are together, we will
 kiss or smile or move.  It’s different too isn’t it
 
 different dear from moving as we,you
 and i,used to move when i thought you were going to(but
 that doesn’t matter)
 when you thought you were going to America.
                                               Then
 
 moving was a matter of not keeping still;we were
 two alert lice in the blond hair of nothing
