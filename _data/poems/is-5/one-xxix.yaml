 than(by yon sunset’s wintry glow
 revealed)this tall strong stalwart youth,
 what sight shall human optics know
 more quite ennobling forsooth?
 
 One wondrous fine sonofabitch
 (to all purposes and intents)
 in which distinct and rich
 portrait should be included,gents
 
 these(by the fire’s ruddy glow
 united)not less than sixteen
 children and of course you know
 their mother,of his heart the queen
 
 —incalculable bliss!
 Picture it gents: our hero,Dan
 who as you’ve guessed already is
 the poorbuthonest workingman
 
 (by that bright flame whose myriad tints
 enrich a visage simple,terse,
 seated like any king or prince
 upon his uncorrupted arse
 
 with all his hearty soul aglow)
 his nightly supper sups
 it isn’t snowing snow you know
 it’s snowing buttercups
