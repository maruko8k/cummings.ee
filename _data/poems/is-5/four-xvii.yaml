 how this uncouth enchanted
 person,arising from a
 restaurant,looks breathes or moves
 â€”climmbing(past light after
 light)to turn,disappears

 the very swift and
 invisibly living
 rhythm of your Heart possibly

 will understand;
 or why(in

 this most exquisite of cities)all
 of the long a fragile imitation of
 (perhaps)myself carefully wanders
 streets dark and,deep

 with rain....

 (he,slight whom or
 cautiously this person

 and this imitation resemble,
 descends into the earth with the year
 a cigarette between his ghost-lips

 gradually)
 remembering badly,softly
 your
 kissed thrice suddenly smile
