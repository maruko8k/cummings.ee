 touching you i say (it being Spring
 and night) "let us go a very little beyond
 the last road—there's something to be found"

 and smiling you answer "everything
 turns into something else, and slips away....
 (these leaves are Thingish with moondrool
 and i'm ever so very little afraid")
                                     i say
 "along this particular road the moon if you'll
 notice follows us like a big yellow dog. You
 
 don't believe? look back. (Along the sand
 behind us, a big yellow dog that's....now it's red
 a big red dog that may be owed by who
 knows)
       only turn a little your, so. And

 there's the moon, there is something faithful and mad"
 along the brittle treacherous bright streets
 of memeory comes my heart,singing like
 an idiot, whispering like a drunken man

 who(at a certain corner, suddenly)meets
 the tall policeman of my mind.
                                awake
 being not asleep, elsewhere our dreams began
 which now are folded:but the year completes
 his life as a forgotten prisoner

 "Ici?"—"Ah non, mon cheri; il fait trop froid"—
 they are gone:along these gardens moves a wind brining
 rain and leaves, filling the air with fear
 and sweetness....pauses. (Halfwhispering....halfsinging
 
 stirs the always smiling chevaur de bois)
